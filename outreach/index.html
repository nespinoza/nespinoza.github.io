Even before the start of my academic career, I have had a keen interest in science education, 
from (primary, secondary and high) school to unversity-level, including public outreach. This 
has been the main driver in a wide range of projects and activities related to teaching, mentoring 
and outreach that I had led during the past years, which I describe below.

  <h3 itemprop="title">Razones Siderales</h3>
  <p align="justify">
  <span itemprop="address"><span itemprop="locality"><b>"Razones Siderales"</b> is a weekly section I hosted from 2020 to 2022 on the chilean national radio station 
          <a href="https://www.radiousach.cl/podcasts/razones-siderales">Radio USACH</a>. Here, together with the chilean journalist Freddy Stock, we talked about the latest 
          scientific advances on astronomy and astrophysics providing explainations of complex subjects in an entertaining way for the general public. Each of our conversations were 
          released via <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6sK0izR6pdByqYPt0uuoal">podcast</a> (in spanish).

  <h3 itemprop="title">Dimension Futuro</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    <span itemprop="address"><span itemprop="locality"><b>"Dimension Futuro"</b> is a section I hosted until 2017 in the radio show
                    ``Palabras sacan palabras", which went weekly on the chilean radio station
                    <a href="http://www.futuro.cl/blog/category/palabras-sacan-palabras/" target="_blank">Futuro FM</a>.
                    The main aim of this section was to give down-to-Earth explainations of cutting-edge science in an informal
                    and entertaining way. </span>

  <h3 itemprop="title">Order-of-magnitude estimations for high-school students</h3>
  <p align="justify">

  Since 2014 and until 2017, I was a teacher at the <b>Center of Study and Development of Talent at PUC 
  (<a href="http://www.pentauc.cl/" target="_blank">PENTA UC</a>, for its acronym in spanish)</b>, which is
  a center aimed at the academic development of talented high school students, and which offers them
  university-class courses dictated at PUC by professors and researchers. In this context, I developed and delivered a course almost
  every semester on order-of-magnitude estimations, based on the popular lecture notes by Sanjoy Mahajan (which
  can be found <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/oom/" target="_blank">here</a>) to high-school students of all levels. 
  The course turned out to be very popular in the program, and according
  to pre and post tests done to students, it had a significant impact on the ability of each student to both perform
  order-of-magnitude calculations and to develop opinions on topics which they have not thought before based on their
  ability to transfer knowledge into numbers.

  <h3 itemprop="title">Itinerant Physics/Bling Bling Universe</h3>
  <p align="justify">
  <span itemprop="address"><span itemprop="locality"><b>"Itinreant Physics"</b> is the first project I 
  started leading and which started my serious interest on science education. This project, which is led 
  by physics and astronomy undergraduates at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC), focuses 
  on sharing science with chilean schools through several sub-projects, which include training programs for 
  teachers and students in physics and astronomy and material aid for vulnerable primary, secondary and high 
  schools in order to help them develop their own laboratories for their science curriculum. I was the 
  director of the project from 2009 to 2013, time period during which several projects were developed. Among them, 
  I founded the <b>Bling Bling Universe</b> (BBU) initiative, a platform which is active to date and which I coordinated 
  until the end of 2015, and whose aim is to provide tools for high school teachers and students in spanish in order
  for them to be able to explore the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.</span>
