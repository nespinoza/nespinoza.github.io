I'm Néstor Espinoza, an Assistant Astronomer (tenure-track) at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target = "_blank">Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)</a> in Baltimore, 
USA. My research interests are exoplanets: from detection and characterization to how they form and what they are made of. I'm also part of the Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless 
Spectrograph (NIRISS) branch, which supports the instrument onboard the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. 

Before joining STScI in 2019, I was an inaugural 
<a href="http://www.csh.unibe.ch/research/projects/csh_fellowship/index_eng.html" target = "_blank">Bernoulli Fellow</a> and a 
<a href="https://www.iau.org/news/announcements/detail/ann18025/" target = "_blank">Gruber Fellow</a> based at the <a href="http://www.mpia.de/en" target = "_blank">MPIA</a> 
from 2017 to 2019. I obtained my PhD from the <a href="http://www.astro.puc.cl" target = "_blank">Pontificia Universidad 
Católica de Chile</a> in September 2017. I'm also a big statistics enthusiast and love coding.
