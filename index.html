<p>
I'm Néstor Espinoza, an inaugural <a href="http://www.csh.unibe.ch/research/projects/csh_fellowship/index_eng.html" target = "_blank">Bernoulli Fellow</a> (joint 
position between the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany, and the University of Bern at Switzerland) currently based at the 
<a href="http://www.mpia.de/en" target = "_blank">MPIA</a>. I obtained my PhD from the <a href="http://www.astro.puc.cl" target = "_blank">Pontificia Universidad 
Católica de Chile</a> in September 2017. My main research interests are exoplanets: from detection and characterization to how they form and what they are made 
of. I'm also a big statistics enthusiast and love coding.
