I'm Néstor Espinoza, an Assistant Astronomer and Mission Scientist for Exoplanet Science at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target = "_blank">Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)</a> in Baltimore, 
USA. My research interests are exoplanets: from detection and characterization to how they form and what they are made of.

<b>Half my time at STScI is spent discovering and characterizing new transiting exoplanets.</b> The bulk of my science lately is related to characterizing exoplanet atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for which I'm the PI of two programs (<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2113" target = "_blank">PID 2113</a> and <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2159" target = "_blank">PID 2159</a> ), and co-investigator on several <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go" target = "_blank">GO</a> and <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/guaranteed-time-observations" target = "_blank">GTO</a> programs. I'm also a key member of the <a href="http://project-access.space/" target ="_blank">ACCESS</a> survey (on which I based my <a href="https://repositorio.uc.cl/handle/11534/21313">PhD thesis</a>), which aims at performing exoplanet atmospheric detections from the ground. On the discovery side, a big portion of my work involves searching for new exoplanets with <a href="https://tess.mit.edu/" target = "_blank">TESS</a>. I also have a deep interest on precise modelling of exoplanetary astrophysical signatures, and on open-source modelling and analysis tools. This led me to lead the development of 
<a href="https://juliet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">juliet</a>, a versatile modelling tool for transiting and non-transiting exoplanetary systems and co-lead the development 
of <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02382">catwoman</a>, a tool for modelling asymmetric transit lightcurves.

<b>The other half of my time at STScI is spent on providing support for the HST and JWST missions</b>. I work at the Instruments Division's (INS) Division Office as the Mission Scientist for Exoplanet Science, where I oversee support for exoplanet science accross all instruments. I'm also currently the scientific lead of the <a href="http://exoctk.stsci.edu/">Exoplanet Characterization Toolkit (ExoCTK)</a>, which compiles tools to aid JWST and HST proposers interested in doing exoplanetary science and the current lead of STScI's <a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/JTEWG">JWST Time-Series Observations Working Group</a>.
