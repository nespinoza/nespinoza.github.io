I'm Néstor Espinoza, an Associate Astronomer and Mission Scientist for Exoplanet Science at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target = "_blank">Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)</a> in Baltimore, 
USA. My research interests are exoplanets: from detection and characterization to how they form and what they are made of.

<b>Half my time at STScI is spent discovering and characterizing transiting exoplanets.</b> The bulk of my science is related to characterizing exoplanet atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for which I'm the PI (<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2113" target = "_blank">PID 2113</a>, <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2159" target = "_blank">PID 2159</a>, <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=3969" target = "_blank">PID 3969</a>, <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=6456" target = "_blank">PID 6456</a>), and co-investigator on several <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/general-observers/" target = "_blank">GO</a> and <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/guaranteed-time-observations" target = "_blank">GTO</a> programs. I do a lot of science with <a href="https://tess.mit.edu/" target = "_blank">TESS</a>, too, and I'm very excited about transiting exoplanets with <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target = "_blank">Roman</a>. I also have a deep interest on developing open-source modelling and analysis tools. I'm the lead developer of 
<a href="https://juliet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">juliet</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/nespinoza/transitspectroscopy/" target="_blank">transitspectroscopy</a> package and <a href="https://github.com/nespinoza/abeec" target="_blank">abeec</a> (an ABC sampler), <a href="https://github.com/nespinoza" target="_blank">among other software</a>.</p>

<b>The other half of my time at STScI is spent on providing support for the HST and JWST missions</b>. I work at the Instruments Division's (INS) Division Office as the Mission Scientist for Exoplanet Science, where I oversee support for exoplanet science accross all instruments. I'm also currently the scientific lead of the <a href="http://exoctk.stsci.edu/">Exoplanet Characterization Toolkit (ExoCTK)</a>, which compiles tools to aid JWST and HST proposers interested in doing exoplanetary science and the current lead of STScI's <a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/JTEWG">JWST Time-Series Observations Coordination Team</a>. I also lead the <a href="http://rockyworlds.stsci.edu/">Rocky Worlds DDT Program</a>.
