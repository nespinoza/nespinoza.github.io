  <h3 itemprop="title">Stellar heterogeneities and transiting exoplanets</h3>
  <p>
  <b>Context.</b> It has been observed for a long time that unnoculted and occulted stellar heterogeneities can have 
  an impact on the retrieval of transit parameters from exoplanet transit lightcurves. The case of 
  occulted stellar heterogeneities has been extensively discussed in the literature (see, e.g., 
  the models of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1407.4465" target="_blank">Beky et al., 2014</a>, 
  and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.428.3671T" target="_blank">Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013</a>), and has 
  served to understand not only anomalies in transiting exoplanet lightcurves, but also of the underlying properties of the 
  stellar spots, including their contrast distribution, sizes and positions (see, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02583" 
  target="_blank">Morris et al. 2017 and references therein)</a>. However, the more common case of <b>unnoculted</b> 
  stellar spots and its impact on the retrieval of physical parameters from transit lightcurves has not been as extensively studied 
  and modelled. The largest impact is on the transit depth: the apparent dimming of the star as the planet passes in front of it. During periods of 
  low cool spot coverage, the star will appear brigther, and thus the observed dimming will be smaller than when there is a larger spot coverage, 
  where the star is dimmer and thus the transit depth will be larger. However, as has been recently shown by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1711.05691" 
  target="_blank">Rackham et al. (2017)</a>, researchers usually assume that there is a one-to-one correspondance between the level of 
  activity a star shows in its long-term photometric signatures (that arise as spots go in and out of view by the observer) and the 
  spot coverage of the stars, while the situation is much more complex due to the unknown size and contrast of spots, which might include 
  both dark and bright spots. This assumption is usually used to correct for stellar activity in exoplanet atmosphere studies (see, 
  e.g., <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1103.0026" target="_blank">Sing et al., 2010</a> and references therein), 
  but the level at which this correction is acceptable has not been empirically studied, and only put to question by the simulations performed 
  by Rackham et al. (2017). In this work, we aim at performing an empirical study to quantify this, and inform future exoplanet atmospheric studies 
  on its impact.
  <br>
  <b>Specific tasks.</b> Lightcurves of transiting extrasolar planets from the Kepler mission will be modelled using state-of-the-art modelling 
  techniques, as well as rotational modulation signals from the stars they transit (the first using known models of transiting exoplanet lightcurves, the latter 
  using gaussian process regression, both using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in Python). These two pieces of information will allow us to asses how the transit 
  parameters evolve as a function of the level of photometric activity of the star, and quantify how far off from this empirical "truth" the correction for 
  exoplanet atmospheric studies. Additionally, important stellar parameters such as limb-darkening and its evolution will be able to be extracted from these 
  transit lightcurves, providing an additional piece of information that will be analyzed in order to understand how the brightness profile of the star changes 
  as a function of time.

  <h3 itemprop="title">An open-source, analyitical retrieval suite for exoplanet atmosphere studies</h3>
  <p> 
  <b>Context.</b> Transmission spectroscopy, the change of the size of a planet as a function of wavelength due to the different constituents and opacity sources in its 
  atmosphere, has revolutionized our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, allowing us to retrieve important molecules such as water from wavelengt-dependant transit 
  lightcurves. Its modelling through atmospheric retrievals, where either the ratio between the constituents in the atmospheres or the abundances of the different elements that 
  make it up are left as free parameters, has been in turn a huge advancement towards the interpretation of this data. Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02051">Heng 
  and Kitzmann (2017)</a> has provided a set of analytical formulae to compute model transmission spectra given a set of elemental abundances and opacities. On the other hand, 
  opacities can be obtained from different tables, while abundances of elements can be either fitted directly or constrained using chemical equilibrium, for which both analytical and 
  non-analytical techniques exist. In this project, the objective is to write a simple yet powerful retrieval suite from the analytical formulae provided by Heng and Kitzmann 
  (2017), and couple it with either analytical formulae for chemical equilibrium or with brute-force Gibbs free energy minimization, in order to generate a tool with which 
  to quickly analyze transmission spectra.
  <br>
  <b>Specific tasks.</b> The first task would be to joint the analytical formulae from Heng and Kitzmann (2017) with a posterior sampling technique such as MultiNest (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437" target="_blank">Feroz et al., 2008</a>). This will allow to perform retrievals free of any chemical constrain on data, and thus the next step would be to test this 
tool against known results from transmission spectroscopy data in the literature. The following step would be to join this tool with both brute-force Gibbs free energy minimization 
(through, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/nespinoza/pyCEA" target="_blank">pyCEA</a>) and/or with analytical chemical equilibrium calculations, and compare them to both transmission 
spectrum models and to real data.

  <h3 itemprop="title">An homogeneous study of known transiting exoplanets</h3>
  <p>
  <b>Context.</b> Transiting exoplanets are one of the best studied exoplanets. If combined with radial-velocity measurements, the mass and radius can be 
  extracted for them, allowing us to search for correlations between their fundamental parameters, aiding us in the understanding of their formation and 
  evolution, which in turn allows us to understand their present states in terms of their shapes and composition. This has allowed us to understand, for example, 
  that giant exoplanets are very metal enriched (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07854" target="_blank">Throngren et al., 2016</a>), which has huge 
  implications for their compositions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08616" target="_blank">Espinoza et al., 2017</a>) and to the impact that, e.g., stellar 
  irradiation has on them (see, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04539" target="_blank">Throngren and Fortney, 2017</a>, 
  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...540A..99E">Enoch et al., 2012</a>). The big problem, however, is that the properties of the hundreds of exoplanets 
  known to date have been obtained with different methods and tools, and thus, not only we could be currently missing important correlations on this dataset, but also  many 
  spurious correlations between the parameters might be polluting this sample. In this project, the aim is to perform the first stage of a homogeneous study of transiting 
  exoplanets using state-of-the-art analysis tools.
  <br>
  <b>Specific tasks.</b> The main engine for the joint analysis of radial velocities and transits will be exonailer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07608" 
  target="_blank">Espinoza et al., 2016</a>; see the <a href="https://github.com/nespinoza/exonailer" target="_blank">code in GitHub</a>). However, this engine is currently 
  using an MCMC engine which does not allow to perform proper, bayesian model comparison. The first task will be to implement MultiNest 
  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437" target="_blank">Feroz et al., 2008</a>) to this engine, which allows to perform proper model comparison between datasets. This first 
  task will have a huge impact not only on this project, but on many future projects involving the discovery of new transiting extrasolar planet systems. The second task will be 
  to perform a data collection search on transit lightcurves and radial velocities for the systems in this homogeneous study, and perform a joint analysis with exonailer, and use 
  them to search for (new and known) correlations between the parameters of the systems.

  <h3 itemprop="title">Bayesian Model Averaging v/s Gaussian Process Regression in exoplanet atmosphere studies</h3>
  <p>
  <b>Context.</b> Exoplanet atmosphere studies are difficult to perform mainly because of systematic effects on time-series data, which are hard to model due do the poor knowledge 
  of their causes. It has been shown by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.3401G" traget="_blank">Gibson (2014)</a> that both model averaging (a technique 
  which averages our ignorance about the correct model of the systematic effects present in a time-series) and gaussian process regression can alleviate the problem and produce 
  reliable inference, with the latter method gaining large popularity in the recent literature. It is unclear, however, how gaussian process regression as compared to model averaging 
  compare against <b>real</b> datasets in the low number of datapoints regime, as simulations usually have added systematic noise close to the model used to account for it. In this 
  project, we will inject model transit lightcurves to real time-series obtained in the context of the ACCESS survey 
  (see <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2017/pdf/3355.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> for a description of the survey) in order to understand which one of the 
  two methods is the most reliable in extracting the real underlying injected system parameters.
  <br>
  <b>Specific tasks.</b> A gaussian process regression will have to be implemented alongside MultiNest (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437" target="_blank">Feroz et al., 2008</a>) 
  in order to analyze the lightcurves. This same posterior sampling technique will be used for model averaging. Once these tools are set, injection and recovery tests will be 
  performed in order to understand how well each method performs, allowing us to understand the real setbacks of each of the analysis techniques used to analyze the data, helping us 
  understand which one is the "best" for the applications of the ACCESS survey.
